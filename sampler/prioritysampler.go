// Package sampler contains all the logic of the agent-side trace sampling
//
// Currently implementation is based on the scoring of the "signature" of each trace
// Based on the score, we get a sample rate to apply to the given trace
//
// Current score implementation is super-simple, it is a counter with polynomial decay per signature.
// We increment it for each incoming trace then we periodically divide the score by two every X seconds.
// Right after the division, the score is an approximation of the number of received signatures over X seconds.
// It is different from the scoring in the Agent.
//
// Since the sampling can happen at different levels (client, agent, server) or depending on different rules,
// we have to track the sample rate applied at previous steps. This way, sampling twice at 50% can result in an
// effective 25% sampling. The rate is stored as a metric in the trace root.
